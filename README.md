The TimeSpan project focuses on creating a class that represents a duration of time using hours, minutes, and seconds. The TimeSpan class normalizes these values to ensure seconds and minutes fall within the range of -60 to 60 while hours remain unrestricted. It supports various constructors, allowing initialization with seconds, minutes and seconds, or hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, creating a TimeSpan(1.5, 4, -10) results in a normalized duration of 1 hour, 33 minutes, and 50 seconds. The class includes accessor functions for retrieving hours, minutes, and seconds, and a method to update these values. Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and unary negation are supported, along with compound assignments (+=, -=). Comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) allow direct comparisons between durations. Stream I/O operators make it easy to input and output TimeSpan objects. Input involves reading hours, minutes, and seconds, while output follows the format: Hours: <value>, Minutes: <value>, Seconds: <value>. For instance, a TimeSpan(1, 2, 3) outputs as Hours: 1, Minutes: 2, Seconds: 3. This project includes time_span.h for the class definition, time_span.cpp for its implementation, and a suite of comprehensive unit tests to validate functionality. Tests cover edge cases for normalization, arithmetic and comparison operators, and I/O operations.
